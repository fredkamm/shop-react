# Shop-app-react

This is a simple e-commerce website using react and redux in the front end; Strapi for the back end; and Stripe for the payment system.


# Inspiration

Building a fully functioning and also responsive e-commerce site is something i wanted to accomplish since starting my coding journey. I'm happy I was able to display some of my skills while creating this application.

# Future Development
- Users create an account
- Users have their own profile page
- Search Functionality
- Wish-list functionality
